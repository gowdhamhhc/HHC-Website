                            In 2019, HashHackCode came to life with a visionary mission. Its founder, Manu Sekar, driven by a simple radical idea, saw the need to make tech education accessible for everyone. We recognized that many individuals with diverse cognitive abilities encountered challenges within the traditional higher education model, often leading to limited career avenues. Identifying this critical void, HashHackCode was born to bridge this gap, empowering learners of all backgrounds to access and excel in tech education.

Our mission is to make this bridge accessible to everyone, transcending limitations and creating a future where technology is an enabler, not a barrier.
